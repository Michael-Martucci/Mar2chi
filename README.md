# 🛠️ Early Work

This repository contains a couple of small beginner projects I created while learning the fundamentals of software development.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 1. Java Scanner
A short Java file showcasing how to use the `Scanner` class to take user input from the console.

### 2. Python Chess Game
A lightweight text-based chess game written in Python (with help from ChatGPT), designed to simulate chess logic and basic gameplay.

> 💡 These projects are not intended to be polished products — they represent early steps in my learning journey as a developer.

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to structure a small project
- How to commit and push changes using Git
- Basic syntax in languages like Python, HTML, CSS, or JavaScript
- Writing simple logic, using loops and conditionals

## 🔧 Future Plans
I may refactor or expand on these projects in the future as I continue to grow my skills.
